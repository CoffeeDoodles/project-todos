# Project Todos

Goal: To understand how to use Redux with React by building a to-list application in which I can add, remove, and tally the completed tasks.

## The problem

Tools Used:
React
Redux
Styled-Components
Material UI Icons & Checkboxes

Redux was hard to grasp at first, not fully understanding the store. However thought slow I was able build the project successfully for basic requirements. However I found styling overwhelming, not really understanding how styled-components worked. Coming back to it now I have a better understanding of it was able to style my application better as well as add in custom checkboxes and buttons using Material UI and Icons. 

If I had more time I'd like to do some of the stretch goals like a Clear All button, time stamps, and even some kind of sorting for completed vs incomplete tasks. I'd also like to add catagories to sort into for tasks.
