# The Project: Todo List

Goals:
<ul>
  <li>Understanding redux-toolkit plays</li>
  <li>Creating Slices</li>
  <li>Creating Reducers</li>
  <li>Creating new actions</li>
  <li>Understanding the Store and how immutability works</li>
  <li>Add new tasks to list, delete tasks, and keep track of how many are completed.</li>
</ul>

# The Problem

At the time of this assignment I was mentally checked out and overworked. So I'd say my biggest problem was finding the motivation to understand this complicated thing called Redux.

However now having worked with Redux more I found this project a 
alot less daunting to work with. I even managed to figure out how to use Material Ui for custom checkboxes which helped style my list in a more fun and unique way. I originally didn't understand how to style it with styled-componenets but that is no longer the case.

If I had more time I would like to build a more complicated component so that I could sort tasks into catagories and delete all the tasks available. I would also like to build a backend to store the data in so the information is saved.
